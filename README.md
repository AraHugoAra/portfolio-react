--- Project is live here: https://portfolio-trebor-front.herokuapp.com/ ---

Well... It's not live anymore due to Heroku's changed plans. 
I'm working on a full migration but this project is relying on a React front + a Node back + a postgreSQL API linked to Strapi and AWS. So it's gonna take time !
